# Nico's Usability Engineering Journal

I am a senior comp sci major in my 3rd to last (including this summer).
This class will be an interesting flip side to the software engineering class that I took last semester.
While last semester was all about the MVP and function, I am interested in chasing usability, flow, and form in this class.
